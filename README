# Cneuromod friends stimuli dataset

This dataset comprises stimuli (video segments) and associated derivatives (language annotations) sourced from the [Friends TV show (1994 - 2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/).

## Friends Video Segments
This section includes the .mkv video files, each containing approximately 12-minute segments from episodes across all 6 seasons of Friends. Accompanying these video segments is a set of Bash scripts used for segmenting the data. The purpose of segmenting the data was to create video clips of convenient duration for subjects to watch during fMRI scans.

## Language Annotations
This dataset includes language annotations in both .json and .tsv formats, derived from the dialogues within Friends episodes as originally presented in the DVDs. 

### Forced-Alignment
To obtain the language annotations, the dialouges were subjected to a sequence of manual and automated data preprocessing steps, followed by a force alignment procedure. The force alignment was achieved by aligning the words in the dialogues with the corresponding audio in each episode via a Python library (https://github.com/zacandcheese/align_friends), which uses an automatic phonetic alignment toolkit [The Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner](https://babel.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/old_website_2015/p2fa/index.html) based on the [The Hidden Markov Model Toolkit](https://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/).

### Full transcripts
In addition to the alignment files, two CSV files containing full transcripts of dialogues from all 10 seasons of Friends are provided, as `original_friends_transcripts.csv` refers to the transcripts from the original DVDs, while `crowd_sourced_friends_transcripts.csv` contains the crowd-sourced (https://fangj.github.io/friends/) data. The structure of the utterances extracted from the original DVDs remains unchanged; hence, the number and structure of utterances may differ between the original and crowd-sourced transcripts.

### Exploratory Analysis
A Jupyter notebook `Friends_Transcripts_Analysis.ipynb` is also included, offering descriptive statistics regarding word usage, dialogue characteristics, token distribution, and narrator attributes within the dataset. Various figures are included to facilitate further exploration of the dataset.
