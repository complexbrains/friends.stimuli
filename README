# Cneuromod friends stimuli dataset

The CNeuroMod data and their derivatives are shared under a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) that is under the ownership of the CNeuroMod team and the participants.

The data contains language annotations (force-aligned time-stamps for each of the word)for the transcript extracted from the original Friends DVDs. Alongside the alignment we also provide two csv files which contain the full transcripts obtained from the DVDs and crowd-sourced transcript. The structure of the utterances extracted from the original DVDs were maintained as original, therefore the number of utterances of the orignal and crowd-sourced transcripts might differ.
